The rapper was soon announced as dead after the incident.</p><p>As of right now, all we know from social media is that famous musician WizDaWizard was discovered shot to death in Miami, Florida. We’re working feverishly to gather credible information on this.</p><p>As a result, the only information we can confidently affirm is that the beautiful soul has passed away.</p><p>Official information concerning the alleged incident has yet to be released. Users on Twitter and Reddit, on the other hand, are going wild over the reported shooting.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wizdawizard-age-wiki-and-real-name></span>Wizdawizard Age Wiki And Real Name<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wizdawizard had not yet revealed his true identity. We hope to learn it soon as his family members speak on the topic.</p><p>Wizdawizard does not have his own Wikipedia bio as of 2021. The rapper was just at the age of 24 before meeting his demise.</p><p>But he was well-known, working with many mainstream artists who had been connected deep inside the rap world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wizdawizard-beef-with-kodak-details></span>Wizdawizard Beef With Kodak- Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wizdawizard beef with Kodak is related to the contract Wizdawizard has signed.</p><p>Wizdawizard accused Kodak of making him sign a bad deal which only generated him 30k and also limiting him from releasing songs independently.</p><p>Well, Kodak fired back at him by saying many slurs to him. Saying Wiz is an idiot and he knows what the contract was. Complaining Wiz should have read the agreement correctly and stop making a fuss about it now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wizdawizard-net-worth></span>Wizdawizard Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wizdawizaed Networth has yet to be released by the media or any trustworthy sources.</p><p>Based on his rap career, we guess him to have a net worth reaching high as 500,000.
