That November, Watts pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on multiple counts and was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Marriage and Employment</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watts married 34-year-old Shan'ann Cathryn Rzucek (born on January 10, 1984) in 2012.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Married for six years, the Watts had two young daughters, Bella Marie (b. 2013) and Celeste Cathryn (b. 2015), and a son on the way, whom they planned on naming Niko Lee.

According to Chris' confession to authorities, Shan'ann — who was 15 weeks pregnant with their son — proceeded to threaten Chris, saying he'd never see their daughters again, which prompted him to strangle her to death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Four-year-old Bella reportedly walked onto the scene after Shan'ann was killed and asked her father, "What are you doing with Mommy?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Chris' lawyer, Chris had told Bella that her mother was feeling ill and they had to take her to the hospital. He then loaded Shan'ann's body and his two daughters in the car and drove them to his work site, Anadarko Petroleum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once there, he smothered Celeste to death with her favorite blanket and pushed her body into an oil tank. When he returned for Bella, who watched him kill her younger sister, she pleaded with her father: "Please Daddy, don’t do to me what you just did to CeCe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chris proceeded to murder Bella and push her body into another oil tank.

The bodies of Shan'ann, their unborn child and their two daughters were recovered the next day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On August 21, Chris was charged with first-degree murder on five counts (one additional count was added to each child under the age of 12), along with one count of illegal termination of a pregnancy and three counts of criminally disposing of deceased bodies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After pleading guilty to the murders on November 6, 2018, Chris was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on November 19. Shan'ann's family did not pursue the death penalty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chris is currently serving five life sentences (three consecutively, two concurrently) and was transferred in December 2018 to Dodge Correctional Institution in Waupun, Wisconsin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an interview in February 2019, Chris told investigators he was remorseful for the murders and had found God.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Mistress</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In November 2018, Chris' mistress, 30-year-old Nichol Kessinger, spoke publicly about their brief affair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Kessinger, the two had only recently met and became physical that July. She alleged that Chris told her he was in the middle of a divorce and that he was finalizing financial details with his wife.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once news hit that Shan'ann and their two daughters were missing, Kessinger began asking Chris questions. Feeling that he was lying to her, she contacted the local police department and fully cooperated with authorities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It got to a point that he was telling me so many lies that I eventually told him that I did not want to speak to him again until his family was found,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/11/15/christopher-watts-murder-mistress-nichol-kessinger/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Denver Post" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Denver Post</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kessinger added: “I just wanted to help.
