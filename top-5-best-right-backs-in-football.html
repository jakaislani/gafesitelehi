However, the demands of modern football have forced them to contribute to their team’s offensive efforts.</p><p>Full-back transfer fees have risen in recent years, reflecting their growing importance in the modern game. PSG recently paid €60 million for Champions League-winning right-back Achraf Hakimi’s services. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson, and Hakimi, among others, have all played important roles in their teams’ success.</p><p>On that note, here are the five best right-backs in the game right now:</p><h2>Number 5: Kieran Trippier</h2><p>Right-back for Atletico Madrid Several top clubs were interested in signing <strong>Kieran Trippie</strong>r during the summer transfer window of 2021. It is not difficult to see why.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kieran-Trippier-.jpg><p>Tripper has established himself as one of the continent’s best full-backs since moving to Madrid in the summer of 2019. The Englishman is a regular starter for Diego Simeone and plays an important role in the Argentine’s defensive system.</p><p>While most full-backs in the world today are better offensively than defensively, Trippier is well-known for his defensive abilities.</p><p>Trippier was instrumental in Atletico Madrid keeping 18 clean sheets in 35 appearances across the Champions League and La Liga in the 2020-21 season. The Englishman was also instrumental in England’s incredible run to the Euro 2020 final. Trippier contributed to the Three Lions keeping three clean sheets and conceding only once in five games.</p><p>The 31-year-old has had a good start to his 2021-22 season. Trippier has contributed to his team’s four clean sheets in 12 La Liga games, with only eight goals conceded. He has yet to assist his team in keeping a clean sheet in the Champions League this season.</p><h2>Number 4: Juan Cuadrado</h2><p><strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong>, along with Cristiano Ronaldo, was unquestionably Juventus’ best player in the 2020-21 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Juan-Cuadrado.jpg><p>The Colombian international has spent most of his career as a wide midfielder. But, under former Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri, he quickly adapted to the right-back position. Cuadrado has since made the full-back position his own, putting in a string of impressive performances.</p><p>The 33-year-old isn’t the best defensive full-back in the game, but his contributions in the opposition third are unrivaled. Cuadrado had an impressive season with the Bianconneri, recording 19 assists and two goals in 40 appearances. The Colombian had the most assists (11) by a Juventus player in the 2020-21 Serie A season.</p><p>Cuadrado has also improved on the defensive end of the field. Under Massimiliano Allegri, he is one of the first names on the Juventus team sheet.</p><h2>Number 3: Reece James</h2><p><strong>Reece James</strong> has established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world since making his debut for the first team in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Reece-James-1.jpg><p>When he was six years old, the Chelsea player joined the club’s youth academy and worked his way up to the senior squad. His Carabao Cup debut for The Blues against Grimsby Town was the stuff of legends. James had an assist in each half and scored a late goal to help the Blues win 7-1.</p><p>That performance foreshadowed bigger things to come for James, who has now established himself as Thomas Tuchel’s first-choice right-back.</p><p>James has demonstrated his immense talent, particularly in the attacking third, since taking over at right-back for Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta. His precise passing and crossing abilities have resulted in several goals for Chelsea’s counter-attacking squad.</p><p>James has been directly involved in eight goals (four goals, four assists) from as many appearances in the 2021-22 Premier League season. James and Trent Alexander-Arnold are currently the best-attacking right-back in English football.</p><h2><strong>Number 2: Achraf Hakimi</strong></h2><p><strong>Achraf Hakimi</strong> was arguably PSG’s best signing during the summer transfer window of 2021. In the French capital, he got right to work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Achraf-Hakimi.jpg><p>He was the only new major signing for whom PSG paid big bucks this summer. Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos, and Gianluigi Donnarumma were all signed on free transfers. However, the €60 million paid by PSG to Inter Milan to secure Hakimi’s services has proven to be a wise investment thus far.</p><p>Last season, Inter Milan won Serie A thanks to the Moroccan’s marauding runs down the flank and pinpointed crosses into the box. He’s brought that form with him to his new club as well. Hakimi has been directly involved in five goals in 12 Ligue 1 appearances for the Parisians this season (three goals, two assists).</p><p>Last season, Hakimi made 42 appearances in the Champions League and Serie A, scoring seven goals and providing 11 assists.</p><h2>Number 1: Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2><p><strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold</strong> is one of the best-attacking full-backs in the game right now, if not the best.</p><p>In the absence of Virgil Van Dijk last season, the Liverpool academy product’s defensive flaws were exposed. But that doesn’t take away from his exploits in the opposing half.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Trent-Alexander-Arnold.jpeg><p>Alexander-contributions Arnold’s in the attacking third in the 2020-21 Premier League season was on par with some of the league’s best playmakers. The 23-year-old had a cross-completion rate of 23 percent, delivering 297 crosses into the box. He also generated 14 big opportunities and 151 accurate long balls.</p><p>Alexander-Arnold has also had a solid start to his 2021-22 season. The young Englishman has been instrumental in Liverpool’s dominance in the opposing third.</p><p>Alexander-Arnold has seven assists in 12 appearances this season. This includes a thunderous free-kick goal against West Ham in Liverpool’s most recent Premier League game.</p><p>Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is still only 23, is only going to get better, which bodes well for The Reds.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqjsdKtZKuhl53Bbq7AnKKsZZmjeqe7zq2ZmqScZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ciggy-black-real-name-everything-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ciggy Black Real Name: Everything You Need To Know">&larr;
