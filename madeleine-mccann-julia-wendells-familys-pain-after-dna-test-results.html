Her mother Dorota is just beside herself, she can’t believe how this has snowballed, Julia is very sick and Dorata just wants her to get the help she needs.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“It was clear from the beginning that Julia was not Madeleine and Dorota is furious that this so-called doctor exploited the illness of a very young woman.</p><p>“Dorota is mortified that all this publicity has caused fresh grief for the McCann family.”</p><p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> also discovered Wendell had previously claimed to be another missing girl in her mid-teens and also contacted a Polish charity with other outlandish identity claims.</p><p>A spokesperson for the charity told the <i>Mail</i>: “Julia has messaged us twice to say she is a missing person, once to say she was German and once to say she was American.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“Neither were correct and we have been helping Julia’s family as best we can because it’s quite clear she is not very well and is constantly claiming to be people she isn’t.”</p><p>Wendell herself says she is “struggling to understand” the results of her recent DNA test and <a href=#>has hit out at Johansson</a>.</p><p>She went on Instagram to accuse Johansson of “trying to scare me”, asking if her offers to help were genuine, <i>LBC News</i> reported.</p><p>She also accused Johansson of <a href=#>withholding important information from the DNA tests</a>, leaving her “struggling to understand” the results, which showed she could not be Maddie.</p><p>Wendell previously said she first suspected she was the missing British girl last year, after years of questioning her family history.</p><p>She did not send DNA to the British police, instead choosing a DNA test to probe her ancestry.</p><p>She has said she would wait for the results before going further with her claims, but when the results arrived, they did not show ancestry that matches with tragic Maddie.</p><p>“She is absolutely, 100 per cent from Poland,” Wendell’s advocate Johansson told Radar Online when the results arrived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/AyN5sLKki1-iyhNC67rK23w2tDE=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/55YMJCCIKFFAHN2IRUZXBBA6ZQ.jpg"><p>Johansson replied to Wendell’s claims on Instagram, saying “Julia was provided all the information about her DNA results to check for herself”.</p><p>“Although Julia is disappointed about this revelation and the spotlight may fade away, the truth as presented in the results speaks to perhaps an unwelcome new reality,” Johansson wrote.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“I am glad she is safe and sound with her family, [which] she perhaps does not want. Her doctor of several years had prescribed medication, which she was not taking consistently.”</p><p>Wendell’s former confidante also revealed <a href=#>the Polish woman does not have leukaemia</a>, but instead suffers from Cushing’s Syndrome, a pituitary disorder.</p><p>“Julia – I wish you the best despite what you say. We had an eventful journey, but like all good things there is always an ending, sometimes happy and sometimes sad,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite speaking to media around the world on her behalf, <a href=#>including an appearance on the Dr Phil show</a>, Johansson now says she did not believe Wendell’s story.</p><p>“I have always believed Madeleine is alive, but when I flew out to Poland, I knew Julia wasn’t Madeleine,” she told the <i>Daily Mirror</i>.</p><p>“I knew all of the disorders Julia had. She was immature and couldn’t recognise who she was.

Next time, it could be Madeleine.”</p><p>The parents of<a href=#> Madeleine McCann</a> issued a statement earlier this week after the DNA test proved that Wendell could not be their long-lost child.</p><p>A spokesman for Madeleine’s parents <a href=#>Kate and Gerry McCann</a> said: “There isn’t anything to report at this time.
