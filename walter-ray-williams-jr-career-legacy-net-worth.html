He has not disclosed if he has a sibling or not either.</p><p>There is no information about Walter’s childhood either, but it is known that Walter was known as the prodigy child in Horseshoe pitching, and he was extremely good at it since his early days.</p><p>As for his education, Walter attended Cal Poly Pomona University and graduated from there in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and a minor in mathematics.</p><p>Walter was a very bright student. Although he was better at bowling and horseshoe pitching, his educational background was also very proficient.</p><p>In one interview, he stated that he would be working for NASA if he was not a bowler.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=walter-williams-nationality-ethnicity-and-horoscope></span>Walter Williams: Nationality, Ethnicity, and Horoscope<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Walter is a proud American born and raised in San Jose, California, in America.</p><p>Apart from his nationality, there is not much information about his background.</p><p>His ethnicity and family background are not disclosed yet too.</p><p>Talking about his horoscope, he falls on the Libra sign.</p><p>Furthermore, Libras are known to crave balance in things.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=walter-williams-age-height-weight-and-physical-appearance></span>Walter Williams: Age, Height, Weight, and Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Walter is 63 Years Old.</p><p>The Californian stands at 6 feet and 2 inches tall.</p><p>Unfortunately, his weight and body measurements are not disclosed yet.</p><p>Moving on to his physical appearance, he has brown hair.</p><p>Similarly, he has brown eyes as well.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Alexander Gustafsson: Girlfriend, Career & Net Worth>></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=walter-willams-horseshoe-pitching></span>Walter Willams: Horseshoe Pitching<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before his successful bowling career, Walter began his horseshoe pitching career when he was 11 years old.</p><p>He was known as the prodigy child of horseshoe pitching. He officially debuted in a tournament in 1970.</p><p>Williams participated in the 1971 Junior Boy’s world championship for horseshoe pitching.</p><p>To no one’s surprise, he won the tournament easily and continued his win next year.</p><p>He won the Junior Boy’s World Championship for two consecutive years in 1971 and 1972.</p><p>Additionally, Walter won the Junior Boy’s World Championship in 1975.</p><p>Moreover, the most fantastic thing is that he did not lose a single game in these three tournaments that he won.</p><p>After finishing the junior championship, Walter pitched in the Men’s world championship in 1977, but unfortunately, he could not win.</p><p>But next year, in 1978, he attained his first-ever Men world championship.</p><p>After this win, he began dominating the scene single-handedly.</p><p>He won 5 more World championships in 1980, 1981, 1985, 1991, and 1994.</p><p>His stats were crazy in the tournament as he had 162 wins and just four losses throughout all these years.</p><p>During the prime of his career, he also pitched at the Whitehouse alongside president George H.W.

In 2003, he became the first bowler to surpass $3 million in career earnings.</p><p>By 2003, Walter had already accumulated a total win of 41 titles and matched the record of Earl Anthony.</p><p>In the same year, he won the Dydo Japan Cup and surpassed his record of Earl to become the player with the most PBA tour titles.</p><p>Due to his precise and accurate shots, he was known as the ‘Deadeye’ in the bowling world.</p><p>And in 2008, he became the only player in bowling to get to $4 million in career earnings.</p><p>Again in 2009, he won another PBA title and expanded his one title per season record to 17 years.</p><p>He needed two more years of consistency to break his record of Earl.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not win any titles in the 2010 season, and his 17 years long consistent record came to an end.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joining-the-senior-tour></span>Joining the Senior Tour<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2010, Walter turned 50 years old, which meant it was time for him to move on to the PBA50 tour.</p><p>He debuted in the PBA50 tour around the mid of 2010. He participated in the Miller High Life Senior Classic.</p><p>Similarly, in 2010, Williams was honored with the title of PBA Senior Rookie of the Year.</p><p>And yes, of course, he won the tournament with ease.</p><p>Walter continued his extraordinary form, and in 2012, he won two more titles, followed by PBA50 player of the year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=retirement-and-stats></span>Retirement and Stats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Walter continued to win many titles, and despite being 59 years old, he won three consecutive titles in 2019.</p><p>He was ready for the 2020 season, but unfortunately, the pandemic hit us, and the organization canceled the PBA50 tour for the year.</p><p>And earlier this year, on March 21, 2021, Walter Ray William Jr. announced his retirement from all bowling scenes.</p><p>The bowler concluded his career with 102 combined PBA titles to his name.

William is the one who is respected more.</p><p>William is the one that is respected and loved more by the fans most due to his calm and relaxed behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, he is widely known to be one of the humblest and most consistent players.</p><p>Many new bowlers idolize him and move forward in their careers.</p><p>Walter is also inducted into the PBA hall of fame, and not to forget that he is also a legend in horseshoe pitching.</p><p>He is also inducted into the World Horseshoe Pitching Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=walter-williams-wife-and-kids></span>Walter Williams: Wife and Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Walter is currently happily married to Fancy Allen.</p><p>The couple got married at Creek Lodge in Lincoln, Calif.</p><p>It was an outdoor event, and the couple invited many people to attend the wedding, and it was grand.</p><p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t Walter’s first marriage. He had to go through a divorce with his ex-wife Paige Pennington.</p><p>Walter and Paige were married for a long time, there is no exact timeline of their marriage, but it was more than a decade.</p><p>They also had an adopted daughter named Rebecca Lynn.</p><p>Walter and Paige got divorced in 2017.</p><p>But things worked out, and Walter is again in a happy relationship with his new wife.
