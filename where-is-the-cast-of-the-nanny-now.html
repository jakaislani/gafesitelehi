The popular ‘90s sitcom provided a lineup of star-studded celebrity guest appearances, a whirlwind of influential fashion brands, and a warm touch of nostalgic humor. The series ran on CBS from 1993 to 1999, and ultimately transformed Fran Drescher into a household name.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>The Nanny follows Fran Fine, a boisterous, loud-mouthed door-to-door cosmetics saleswoman who, after her boyfriend ends their relationship, ends up on the doorstep of Maxwell Sheffield, a successful Broadway producer searching for a nanny to his three children — Maggie, Brighton, and Grace.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>Over the show’s six seasons, Fran becomes a permanent fixture in the Sheffield family, sharing a mutual attraction and eventual love with Maxwell and developing a close relationship with his children.
