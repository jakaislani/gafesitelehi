He became most well-known for his Animesh series of novels, the second of which, Kalbela, won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1984. Samaresh was also credited with creating investigator Arjun, the lead character of the 2013 film Arjun – Kalimpong E Sitaharan.</strong></p><p>The Bengali film Buno Haansh, which premiered on August 15, 2014, was influenced by his piece of the same name, which was published in Pujabarshiki Anondolok. His efforts in the book “Kalbela,” which is based on the Naxalite uprising, earned him the “Sahitya Akademi Award.”</p><p>Young kids and adults alike really like Majumdar’s detective character, Arjun. West Bengal’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, offered her condolences on Majumdar’s departure and described it as an irreparable loss to the literary world.</p><h2>Who Is the Wife of Samaresh Majumdar? His Family Information</h2><p>There is no information online about Samaresh Majumdar’s wife. Mazumdar was raised in the Dooars, Gairkata tea gardens in the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, India. In that city, he went to Jalpaiguri Zilla School. He graduated from Scottish Church College in Kolkata with a bachelor’s degree in Bengali literature. The following step was a Bengali literature master’s degree from the University of Calcutta. His first published work was in the literary journal Desh in 1967.</p><p>Dour (“Run”), his first novel, was published in Desh in 1976. He has ties to the important Calcutta publishing house Ananda Bazar Prakashana. Samaresh received a great deal of local, national, and worldwide recognition. He also won the BFJA, Dishari, and Chalachitra Prasar Samity awards for best scriptwriter in 1982.</p><p>The Bankim Puroshkar Award was granted to Samaresh Majumdar in 2009 for “Kolikatay Nobokumar.” It is said that his Trilogy, Uttoradhikar, Kalbela, and Kalpurush, is a contemporary masterpiece. He is one of the best writers in Bangla literature.</p><p>He now writes to Uttar Banga Sangbad, a prominent North Bengali newspaper known as “Soja Sapta.” As soon as we find out more about Samaresh Majumdar’s wife, we’ll let you know.</p><h2>Samaresh Majumdar’s wealth</h2><p>Samaresh Majumdar is said to have a net worth of around $1 million. Mazumdar is a diverse author, yet many of his works have suspense and thrills in them. Some of his novels are Aath Kuthuri Noy Daraja, Bandinibash, Daybadhha, and Buno Haansher Palak.</p><p>Possibly his best-known novel is Saatkahon. Prolific novelist Samares Mazumdar is a master of several genres. He has authored short stories, novels, travel pieces, and works for children. His quartet, Uttoradhikar, Kalbela Kalpurush, and “Mousalkal” are now recognized as contemporary classics.</p><p>He loved Group Theatre very much. He wrote the short tale “Onnomatra” for a theatrical play as his first piece of literature. Later in 1976, his first Desh released “Dour,” his first novel. He also worked on travelogues, adolescent novels, and short fiction.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Kwhxte</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Renata Jara</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Krisztina Wilders Wikipedia | How Old Is Geert Wilders Wife</a></h3>Geert Wilders is a politician in the Netherlands who is on the far right and supports nationalism and popularity.
