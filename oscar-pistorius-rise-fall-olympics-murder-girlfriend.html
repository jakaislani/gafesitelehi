Spurred by parents who refused to accept excuses – "My brother, my sister and I were brought up with one iron rule – no one was allowed to say 'I can't,'" he wrote – Pistorius plunged himself into activities like hiking, bike riding, wrestling and water-skiing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not that his childhood was devoid of difficulties – Henke and Sheila divorced when Pistorius was 6 years old, and he was 15 when his beloved mother died from an allergic reaction to medication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pistorius also suffered a serious knee injury at 16 while playing rugby, but this setback came with a sparkly silver lining, as doctors <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/oscar-pistorius-from-the-podium-to-purgatory/#gallery/oscar-pistorius-from-the-podium-to-purgatory/slide-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=suggested class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">suggested</a> he take up running as part of his rehabilitation.</p><img alt="Oscar Pistorius celebrates as he wins gold in the Men's 400m T44 Final at the 2012 Paralympic Games on September 8, 2012, in London, England" title="Oscar Pistorius celebrates as he wins gold in the Men's 400m T44 Final at the 2012 Paralympic Games on September 8, 2012, in London, England" width=5184 height=3456 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-151574202.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Oscar Pistorius celebrates as he wins gold in the Men's 400m T44 Final at the 2012 Paralympic Games on September 8, 2012, in London, England; Photo: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">He was accused of having an unfair advantage and banned from competing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In January 2004, mere weeks after he began seriously training, Pistorius breezed past the Paralympic world record in the 100-meter dash. That June, he was fitted with his first set of carbon-fiber "Flex-Foot Cheetah" blades, on which he blazed to a world-record mark in the 200 meters at the Paralympics in September.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pistorius' relentless ambition then carried him to competitions against able-bodied runners, a quest that amazed fans but also invited scrutiny from those who wondered whether he was getting an unfair boost from his artificial extremities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In January 2008, following a series of tests, the International Association of Athletics Federations announced that Pistorius was indeed benefitting from his racing prostheses and banned him from all sanctioned events. Fortunately, the ruling was soon <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/oscar-pistorius-olympic-quest-opens-ethical-debate-prosthetics-article-1.328329 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=overturned class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">overturned</a> on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which agreed that any advantages gained by runner on the lightweight blades were offset by the difficulties they presented on the starting block and curved sections of the track.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The restored eligibility wasn't enough to help Pistorius meet his stated goal of qualifying for South Africa's 2008 Olympic track team, though he made a splash at the Paralympics later that summer by claiming gold medals in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter races.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Pistorius' inspirational story masked personal troubles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the next few years, Pistorius' international celebrity was cemented thanks to features in leading publications like Time, GQ and People, though a few behind-the-scenes incidents suggested that trouble was lurking below the surface.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A February 2009 speedboat crash, for example, may have been the result of the empty alcohol bottles <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/06/world/africa/pistorius-image/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reportedly class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">reportedly</a> found onboard. That September, the star sprinter was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscar-pistorius-settles-in-alleged-2009-assault-case/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=arrested class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">arrested</a> for injuring a woman after allegedly slamming a door on her at a party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, the headlines that accompanied his exploits were largely inspirational. In September 2011, Pistorius joined his able-bodied 4x100-meter relay teammates to become the first Paralympian to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/14759376 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="earn a medal" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">earn a medal</a> at the World Championships. The following summer brought his crowning moment at the London Games, followed by two more golds at the Paralympics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Olympic halo was still glowing in January 2013 when Pistorius, at a Johannesburg restaurant with friends, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/oscar-pistorius-gun-shot-restaurant-reeva-steenkamp-trial data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accidentally discharged a gun" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">accidentally discharged a gun</a> beneath the table. Among his companions that day was Steenkamp, his model girlfriend of two months who was preparing her own leap to fame on a reality TV competition.</p><img alt="Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp at the Tasha's All White Party on January 26, 2012, in Johannesburg, South Africa" title="Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp at the Tasha's All White Party on January 26, 2012, in Johannesburg, South Africa" width=2054 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-161748652.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp at the Tashas' All White Party on January 26, 2012, in Johannesburg, South Africa; Photo: Waldo Swiegers/Heat Magazine/Gallo Images/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Pistorius initially received a light sentence for culpable homicide</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A few weeks later, in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, the high life for Pistorius came <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/06/oscar-pistorius-murder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="crashing down" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">crashing down</a> when he fired four gunshots at the locked bathroom door of his home in Pretoria, killing his girlfriend inside.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="highly-publicized trial" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">highly-publicized trial</a> began in March 2014 with a neighbor's testimony of hearing Pistorius and Steenkamp screaming at each other, followed by the shots. In his defense, the Paralympian claimed he fired at the bathroom door in the belief that an intruder was lurking inside, only to belatedly realize it was his lover.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the once-saintly image of Pistorius had since been eclipsed by accounts of him being violent and controlling, it seemed he would be spared the worst punishment by a sympathetic court. Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa chided him for his negligence with a firearm but ultimately found him guilty of culpable homicide – roughly equivalent to manslaughter – and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/21/world/africa/south-africa-pistorius-sentencing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=sentenced class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">sentenced</a> him to five years behind bars in October 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even when the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal in December 2015 and Pistorius faced an upgraded charge of murder, Judge Masipa <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-sentence.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ignored class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">ignored</a> the standard 15-year minimum and handed out a six-year sentence in July 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It took the stern hand of South Africa's top appeals court to once again intervene and extend Pistoruis' "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/24/africa/oscar-pistorius-murder-sentence-increased/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shockingly lenient" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">shockingly lenient</a>" sentence to 13 years and five months in November 2017.
